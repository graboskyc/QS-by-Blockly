# About this Repo

The purpose of this repo is to quickly build out QualiSystems CloudShell environment python scripts via a drag-and-drop interfacce. While the initial build is a proof of concept, the goal is to add the functionality to load an environment's details out of a CloudShell instance and make building blocks out of it to make an orchestration script quickly.
